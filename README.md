# Multinomial-Logistic-Regression-in-Python

This project develops and predicts a three-class classification using a Python machine-learning technique. 

The project walks you through two main stages:
1) The pre-processing step where the data were cleaned, imputed, and transformed to better serve the algorithm's purposes
2) The estimation of the multinomial model, the model fit parameters (accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix).
